        <h4>Dec 21, 2015</h4>
        <p>I was traveling for the first time on my own. I was going to Toronto and was going to be there for a few weeks. It would also be the first time I would experience snow.</p>

        <h2>Toronto</h2>
        <p>A few days in toronto and I did fall in love with the place. There is plenty of things to do and public transport is actually really good compared to areas I'm used to in the US.
          I will include photos below that I enjoyed taking of Toronto. Poutine tastes fucking amazing, pardon my french.

          <h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
          <p>I got to experience Niagara Falls for a few days. To be honest there isn't a whole lot to do thats unique at Niagara falls but I do recommend people to come and experience the falls at least once.

            <h2>Random Areas </h2>
            <p>I also took pictures of random locations that attracted my attention while in Canada. I did forget to mention above that snow is quite fun and I turned into a small kid and enjoyed doing snowball fights and such.</p>
